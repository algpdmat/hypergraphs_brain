Project Structure
This project consists of several Python functions that are used to create and analyze high-order brain networks. Each function is designed to handle specific aspects of creating and analyzing high-order brain networks. You can use these functions in your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks to perform topological data analysis on brain network data. The functions provided here are flexible and can be adapted to various types of network data.
